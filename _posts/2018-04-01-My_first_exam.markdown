For my first exam I decided to go with the lowest hanging exam fruit, VMware, due to my two years of experiance working with the vendor and their technology stack. But this is only half of the battle, as you can see below their are many exams that VMware offer, but which one is right for you? or anyone for that matter.

That is a question that is not easily answered, I chose the VCP6-DCV qualification as the VCA6 didnt hold enough sway for my liking (I felt it was a glorified sales cert) and im not a "Network" guy so the NV (Network Virtualisation) stream was not for me. VCP6-DCV seems to be the benchmark cert in VMware's inventory in which others are comapred to, sure there are more advanced certs but this is a great starting point.

Once I had picked the cert it was onto fulfilling the requirements:
1. Sit and pass the Vmware foundations exam.
2. Complete a vSphere 6 course
3. Sit and pass the VCP6-DCV exam

I spent the next three months studying my little butt off, each night, some mornings all my weekends were gone, I was a blur of paperwork and coffee, the details of which you can find in my next blog post.





Stay tuned to find out which cert I decided to go with second [here]({{ site.url }}/study/2017/04/21/Studying_for_AWS_CSA_exam.html "My Second Exam")
