2017 is my year... that's the motto. 

I have been working as a virtualisation engineer (predominantly VMware) for almost 2.5 years now. About six months ago I started to get restless, the type of restless that leaves you unsatisfied after a days work and doubting your career path, while you stare aimlessly at your bedroom ceiling, hoping to fall asleep. This was not acceptable, something had to change. 

I should give you a little background, for the past five'ish years, I had been steadily working my way up the meritocracy that is, my service provider employer. Starting in the call centre, then moving to senior call centre officer, tier 2 support, tier 3 Microsoft support and finally a move into virtualisation. It had been fun, challenging, and even stressful on my way up, the jobs were constantly changing, tasks becoming more complex, my nerdery levelling up. It wasn't until I stayed in this virtualisation team for two years that I had a chance to grow.... bored for lack of a better word. It was then that I realised why I was restless, I was bored, I also felt locked into my current job as I do not have any I.T qualifications. Who would hire me without any proof that I know, what I know I know? 

There was only one solution, to get certified! 2017 is my year... that's what I told myself, as I embarked on this journey to prove to myself and to the world that I am a skilled and passionate I.T engineer. But where do I start? Do I start with the [Microsoft program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/learning/mcsa-certification.aspx/ "Microsoft Certifications")? As I had been working with Windows server for the past while and I found it easy (but also boring). Or do I go down the [VMware path](https://mylearn.vmware.com/portals/certification/ "VMware Certifications") as I was currently working with the technology. 

Stay tuned to find out which cert I decided to go with [here]({{ site.url }}/study/2017/04/28/My_first_exam.html "My First Exam")




**TLDR - have been working in I.T for a while now, working my way up was interesting, got bored by staying in one job for 2 years, felt trapped by lack of qualifications, decided to get myself qualified in 2017**
