Hello! Firstly, I would like to say thank you for stopping by and taking a look at my blog!

My name is Alex Simpson. I am originally from New Zealand and am now based in Brisbane, Australia. I'm an avid technology enthusiast and aspiring cross public cloud engineer. I have been working in I.T for 6 years now, and I love it. I originally studied commerce at university but found that the corporate life was not for me.  

//EDIT June 2018 I am now working as consulting cloud solutions engineer, specialising in AWS, thanks in large part to this blog and all the certifications I completed for AWS. im leaving the above to remember where I came from.

Some may be wondering, what the name of this blog means. Pebkac, is an acronym for "problem exists between keyboard and chair", it is a go-to term around my organization for user error. I chose it as the name of this blog as a lot of the issues we face in I.T are "pebkac" related. Usually, because the person committing the pebkac is trying to learn something new and push their boundaries, as a wise woman once told me _"if you are not making mistakes, you are not learning"_ (thanks, mum). As "pebkac" is a large portion of the learning process and this blog is about me learning the public clouds (AWS, Azure and Google) it seemed like an apt name.

So please follow along on my journey to be a cross public cloud engineer!

My name is Alex Simpson, im an avid technology enthusiast and aspiring cross-cloud engineer. I have been working in I.T now for 6 years, starting as most of us do in a call center. From there I moved on to our companys microsoft team and them to our companys virtualisation team where I have been dealing mostly with Vmware for the last 3 years. About one year ago I got bored, bored with my work and bored with VMware on prem tech, so I started to branch out  

I am originaly from New Zealand and am now based out of Brisbane Australia. I say "originally from New Zealand" as I left the country when I was 3 months old, and spent the better part of 9 years in Saudi Arabia, as my dad moved there for work. I feel this start to life granted me a unique outlook and I am ever so appreciative of it.


A medium inspired Jekyll blog theme. The basic idea came from the Ghost theme 
[Readium 2.0](http://www.svenread.com/readium-ghost-theme/). I use mediator on my own blog [The Base](blog.base68.com).

You can **download** the theme here:

You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at [jekyllrb.com](http://jekyllrb.com/)
