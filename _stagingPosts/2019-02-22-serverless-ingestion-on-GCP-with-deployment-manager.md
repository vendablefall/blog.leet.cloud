Hello, and welcome back to another post by yours truely (thats me btw :-)). Recently there has been a little change in my life, I got a new job, and with the new job came a career pivot. WHere I was an AWS consultant, I am now a data engineer working exclusivly with Google Compute Platform (GCP) for a great company called (Datisan)[www.datisan.com.au]. Now the data engineering it not exactly brand new to me as a few of my last AWS clients wanted data lakes and ingestiom pipelines setup, the GCP side of things is brand new to me.
