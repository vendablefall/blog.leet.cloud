As you can probably guess from the image above I decided my second exam/certification would be of the AWS flavour more specifically the  Certified Solutions Architect - Associate. I came to this decision for a few reasons, they have 80% of the public cloud market share, also because my workplace is pretty much a microsoft shop if felt branching out and doing something different would give me a point of difference in a sea of MS (Microsoft) fanboys. Not to say that I am not a fanboy myself, I think in I.T we all have alegancies to “our” tech, as thats part of the fun. I didnt really have a timeline panned for booking my exam, I was simply going to throw myself into the study, start some personal projects hosted on AWS and take the exam when I felt I was ready. 

The main source of study for me was the acloud.guru website and their certified solutions architect associate course which can be found [here [link]]. I really couldnt recommend these guys and higher, their courses have great conten and they listen to their customers feedback to imporove the whole experience. If you are looking at getting AWS qualified I would urge you to go and buy their course. Over the course of three months or so I tried to get through thirty minutes of lecure videos a day, as my girlfriend works weekends and I was full of enthusiasm I spent most weekends studying. This meant I got through 95% of the acloud.guru course in just under 3 months. 

As you might have guessed by now pebkac (this blog) is my first project using AWS. It is a static site built with jekyll, hosted on S3 with Route53 doing all the DNS work. I chose jekyll because I had just formatted my aging windows 10 laptop to put linux mint on and it was a great way to practise my bash/ruby skills. A more indepth post about my learning experience for linux can be found [[here] link].

Once I started getting 85%+ on all the free practise quizess you can find around the web [[here]link] and [[here]link] I thought it was time to book my exam.
