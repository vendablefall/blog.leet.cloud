As the title suggests, I failed my first exam yesterday, the AWS - Advanced Networking Specialty. I was pretty dejected coming out of the exam, all the time I had spent studying, for naught, not to mention the $440 AUD that it cost me to sit the exam. This post will be a re-cap of my study for this exam, my opinions, now that I have had a good nights sleep and finally my attitude going forward.

.. Whats that you say? I shouldn't of attempted the "Advanced" course if I didnt have networking fundimentals down? Well.. good point... in my defence, I have been working with VMware Virtual networking for many years now, so I felt like I knew enough, I didnt. The old saying comes to mind
"you dont know, what you dont know" and for this exam I evidentaly didnt know enough fundimentals of routing, switching and networking.
