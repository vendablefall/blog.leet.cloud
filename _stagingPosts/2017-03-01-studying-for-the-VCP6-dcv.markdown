For my first exam, I decided to go with the "lowest hanging fruit" which in my case is a VMware, due to my two years of experience working with the vendor and their technology stack. However, this is only half of the battle, as you can see below there are many exams that VMware offer, but which one is right for me? Or, anyone for that matter.

That is a question that is not easily answered; the VCA6 didn't hold enough sway for my liking (I felt it was a glorified sales cert), I am not a "Network" guy, so the VCP6-NV (Network Virtualisation) stream was not for me. I chose the VMware certified professional in data centre virtualisation (VCP6-DCV) qualification as VCP6-DCV seems to be the benchmark cert in VMware's inventory (the cert which others are compared), sure there are more advanced certs, but the VCP6-DCV is a great starting point. 

Once I had picked the cert it was onto fulfilling the requirements:
1. Sit and pass the Vmware foundations exam.
2. Complete a vSphere 6 course
3. Sit and pass the VCP6-DCV exam

Luckily my work had recently sent me on advanced troubleshooting in vSphere 6 courses, which satisfied requirement number 2. With 1 out of 3 requirements satisfied I spent the next three months studying my little (some would argue with the word little) butt off, each night, some mornings all my weekends were gone, I was a blur of paperwork and coffee.

My primary training resource was the Pluralsight course for the [foundations exam](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/career/learning-path-vsphere-6-foundations). This course is comprehensive in covering all you need to know for the foundation's exam; I would highly recommend it.

Once I felt somewhat comfortable with the course material and the syllabus it was time to take the "Vmware foundations exam" luckily this is an online exam and can be sat from the comfort of your own home. I managed to score a 95% on that test, which made me very happy.

Now with 2 out of 3 requirements completed I was invigorated with enthusiasm, every waking moment was spent studying for the final test, again using PluralSight as my primary training resource, specifically the [VCP-DCV6 course](https://www.pluralsight.com/paths/vsphere-6-dcv).

Long story short, I passed with 380/500 or 76%, which I was very proud of, I have since taken the habits I formed in studying for this exam (mainly studying all the time) onwards to achieve 4 AWS certifications, and with it a brand new job with a *much* higher salary. 

If I had any advice to you out there looking to get started with getting certified in I.T, as I did, start with the "lowest hanging fruit" let yourself learn how to study again, then once you are back into the swing of things you can start progressively harder an harder courses.

Until next time...
