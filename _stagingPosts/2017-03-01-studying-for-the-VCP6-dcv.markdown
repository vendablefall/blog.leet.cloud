For my first exam I decided to go with the "lowest hanging fruit" which in my case is a VMware, due to my two years of experiance working with the vendor and their technology stack. But this is only half of the battle, as you can see below their are many exams that VMware offer, but which one is right for me? or anyone for that matter.

That is a question that is not easily answered, the VCA6 didnt hold enough sway for my liking (I felt it was a glorified sales cert), I am not a "Network" guy so the VCP6-NV (Network Virtualisation) stream was not for me. I chose the VMware certified professional in data center virtualisation (VCP6-DCV) qualification as VCP6-DCV seems to be the benchmark cert in VMware's inventory (the cert which others are comapred to), sure there are more advanced certs but the VCP6-DCV is a great starting point. 

Once I had picked the cert it was onto fulfilling the requirements:
1. Sit and pass the Vmware foundations exam.
2. Complete a vSphere 6 course
3. Sit and pass the VCP6-DCV exam

Luckily my work had recently sent me on an advanced troubleshooting in vSphere 6 course, which satisfied requirement number 2. With 1 out of 3 requirements satisfied I spent the next three months studying my little (some would argue with the word little) butt off, each night, some mornings all my weekends were gone, I was a blur of paperwork and coffee.

My main training resource was the Pluralsight course for the [foundations exam](here). This course is really comprehensive in covering all ou need to know for the foundations exam, I would highly reccomend it.

Once I felt somehwat comfortable with the course material and the syllabus it was time to take the "Vmware foundations exam" luckily this is an online exam and can be sat from the confort of your own home. I managed to score a solid 95% on that test which I was very happy with. 

Now with 2 out of 3 requirements completed I was invigorated with enthuseasm, every waking moment was spent studying for the final test, again using PluralSight as my main training resouce specifically the [VCP-DCV6 course](here).
