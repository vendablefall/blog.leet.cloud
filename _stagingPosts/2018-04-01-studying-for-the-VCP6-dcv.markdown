For my first exam I decided to go with the "lowest hanging fruit" which in my case is a VMware, due to my two years of experiance working with the vendor and their technology stack. But this is only half of the battle, as you can see below their are many exams that VMware offer, but which one is right for me? or anyone for that matter.

That is a question that is not easily answered, the VCA6 didnt hold enough sway for my liking (I felt it was a glorified sales cert), I am not a "Network" guy so the VCP6-NV (Network Virtualisation) stream was not for me. I chose the VMware certified professional in data center virtualisation (VCP6-DCV) qualification as VCP6-DCV seems to be the benchmark cert in VMware's inventory (the cert which others are comapred to), sure there are more advanced certs but the VCP6-DCV is a great starting point. 

Once I had picked the cert it was onto fulfilling the requirements:
1. Sit and pass the Vmware foundations exam.
2. Complete a vSphere 6 course
3. Sit and pass the VCP6-DCV exam

I spent the next three months studying my little (some would argue with the word little) butt off, each night, some mornings all my weekends were gone, I was a blur of paperwork and coffee.
